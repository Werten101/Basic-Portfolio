	<img id="Profile_Image" src="Assets/Images/ProfileImage.jpg"> <p id="MainContent"> I'm Alex, i am 19 years old, im Originally from Sochi, Russia. I love cars and motorcycles a whole lot, racing them particularly! but i also enjoy a good old session of digging under the hood (or under the gastank in case of the motorcycle) to find ways to make them faster. i also really like computers and i really enjoy coding, the way the code asembles and makes websites or programs materialize out of my head and onto the screen is truly something i find fascinating and i hope to become a great coder one day. My goal is to become one of the best coders in the world, and i know i have what it takes, it's just going to take some time ;P </p>
